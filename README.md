# Color Scheme Switcher
--- 
A color scheme switcher is a tool or feature that allows users to toggle between different predefined color schemes or themes within an application, website, or digital interface.

---
# Common Use Cases:

Websites: Users can switch between light and dark themes to match their preference or environmental lighting conditions.
Mobile Apps: App interfaces that offer a night mode for comfortable viewing in low-light conditions.
Design Systems: Designers can quickly test different color schemes in design tools to see how they impact the overall look and feel of a project.

---
# Implementation Techniques:

HTML/CSS: Basic theme switching can be implemented using CSS variables or classes that change the colors of elements across the site.
JavaScript: More dynamic color scheme switchers use JavaScript to toggle classes or change CSS variables based on user interaction. JavaScript can also handle storing the user's preference in local storage.

# Example

Imagine a website with a default light color scheme. The color scheme switcher would allow users to click a button or toggle to switch to a dark mode, instantly changing the background color to dark, the text color to light, and adjusting other elements like buttons, links, and headers to match the new scheme.
